## Modules To Refactor

### ðŸ“‹ conformations.py
**Status:** Not started
**Estimated complexity:** Medium

### ðŸ“‹ its.py
**Status:** Not started
**Estimated complexity:** Low

---

## Support Modules (Fixed During Refactoring)

- âœ… `types.py` - Fixed syntax errors, removed incomplete stubs
- âœ… `utils.py` - Fixed missing imports and incomplete function stubs
- âœ… `state.py` - Fixed incomplete class definitions, added PersistentState alias
- âœ… `__init__.py` - Fixed incomplete Backend class, proper mixin imports

---

## Refactoring Pattern Summary

### 1. Import Organization
```python
# Standard library imports (alphabetically)
import logging
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Any, Dict, Optional

# Third-party imports (alphabetically)
import numpy as np

# pmarlo imports (grouped by submodule)
from pmarlo.api.xxx import function_name
from pmarlo.utils.xxx import function_name

# Local imports (relative)
from .types import TypeName
from .utils import helper_function

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

### 2. Module-Level Helper Functions
Functions that can be imported by other modules and don't need `self`

### 3. Mixin Class Structure
Methods that need `self` and access to Backend state
