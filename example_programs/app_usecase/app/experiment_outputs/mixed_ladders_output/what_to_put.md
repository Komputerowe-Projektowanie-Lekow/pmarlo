# Expected E1 Output Layout

Artifacts generated by `run_mixed_ladders.py` should include:

- `analysis_debug/summary.json`: contains TRAM/MBAR diagnostics, DeepTICA pair counts, guardrail statuses.
- Additional debug files (weights, state assignments, transition matrices) nested under `analysis_debug/`.
- `fes_Tref.png`: baseline vs DeepTICA FES comparison after reweighting to `T_ref`.
- `msm_summary.json`: MSM metrics for the reweighted ensemble.
- `weights_summary.json`: shard weight contributions and ESS figures.
- `acceptance_report.md`: PASS/FAIL narrative referencing numeric thresholds from `plan.md`.

Optional extras (e.g., implied timescale plots) can live alongside these core deliverables if needed for analysis.
