# Unnegotiable
Shards should only have one single format. This specifiec all of the things, because other methods count on a specific data format.


# Small desciription
The shard is a mechanic to create a stable unit for the dataset creation.
Shards were supposed to be emited after the replica exchange method.
The shards are supposed to be uniform. So after any simluation they should be already ready for the 
module later.


The module later is MSM and maybe DeepTica training. They should accept only one form of the shard, that is suited for the task.
