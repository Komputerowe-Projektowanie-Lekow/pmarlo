    """Generate a robust set of candidate lag times for MSM ITS analysis.

    Behavior:
    - Uses a curated set of "nice" lags (1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and 10Ã— multiples)
      commonly used for implied-timescale scans.
    - Filters to the inclusive range [min_lag, max_lag].
    - Optionally downsamples to ``n_candidates`` approximately evenly across
      the filtered list while keeping endpoints.

    Args:
        min_lag: Minimum lag value (inclusive), coerced to >= 1.
        max_lag: Maximum lag value (inclusive), coerced to >= min_lag.
        n_candidates: If provided and > 0, downsample to this many points.

    Returns:
        An increasing list of integer lag times.
