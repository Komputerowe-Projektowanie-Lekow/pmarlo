### Added
- Introduced a dedicated "Conformation Analysis" tab in the Streamlit workflow so TPT configuration, shard/run selection, and prior conformation bundles live alongside the other workflow stages.

### Changed
- Persist TPT conformation analyses in the backend state and expose list/load helpers so previously generated conformations can be rediscovered and reloaded from the UI.
