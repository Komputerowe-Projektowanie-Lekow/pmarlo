### Fixed

- Fixed mypy type errors in `replica_exchange/simulation.py`: resolved duplicate Simulation class definition and inconsistent function signatures for `prepare_system`, `production_run`, `build_transition_model`, `relative_energies`, and `plot_DG` to match their full implementation counterparts.
- Fixed multiple mypy type errors across the codebase:
  - Added proper type annotation for `__all__` in `ml/__init__.py`
  - Fixed `_require` argument type error in `shards/schema.py`
  - Fixed union-attr error in `reweight/reweighter.py`
  - Fixed no-any-return errors in `io/shard_id.py`, `data/shard.py`, and `analysis/discretize.py`
  - Added missing type annotations for variables in `replica_exchange/_simulation_full.py`, `features/deeptica_trainer.py`, and `features/deeptica/_full.py`
- Achieved significant progress in mypy type error resolution: reduced from 185+ errors to 121 errors (35% reduction)
- Fixed critical blocking issues: resolved module name conflicts and missing imports that were preventing comprehensive type checking
- Harmonized EnhancedMSM protocols, pipeline helpers, and demux fill-policy handling to match runtime defaults while satisfying the remaining mypy signature checks.
