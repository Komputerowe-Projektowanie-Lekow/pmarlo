### Fixed
- **MSM data storage**: Fixed fundamental issue where detailed MSM statistics (counts, state_counts, transition pairs) were computed during build but immediately discarded. Modified `_build_msm` to return a 3-tuple `(T, pi, msm_data)` containing the full MSM payload including counts, state_counts, counted_pairs, and dtrajs. Updated `_build_msm_payload` to handle both legacy 2-tuple and new 3-tuple formats for backward compatibility.
- **Analysis debug timing**: Fixed critical ordering issue where `compute_analysis_debug` was called BEFORE discretization, causing "transition counts array is empty" errors. The function now explicitly requires dtrajs and raises clear errors when missing (no silent fallbacks). The backend extracts debug data AFTER build completion when MSM data is available.
- **Build result MSM attribute**: The `BuildResult.msm` attribute now contains a complete dict with `transition_matrix`, `stationary_distribution`, `counts`, `state_counts`, `counted_pairs`, `n_states`, `lag_time`, and `dtrajs` instead of being None. This enables proper post-build analysis and debugging.
- **Streamlit app analysis**: Fixed completely broken analysis workflow in the app that was failing with "transition counts array is empty". The app now successfully builds MSMs with proper statistics (tested with 3000 frames → 50 states → 2997 transition pairs).
