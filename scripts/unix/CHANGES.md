# Changes to Codex Environment Scripts

## Date: October 19, 2025

### Update 2: Fixed Lightning Installation and Python 3.13 Support

**Critical Fixes:**
1. **Lightning Installation:** Fixed error where `lightning` couldn't be installed from PyTorch CPU index. Now `torch` is installed from CPU index, and `lightning` is installed from PyPI (via Poetry).
2. **Fixer Extra:** Fixed issue where `black` and `ruff` were not being installed on Python 3.12+. Now the `fixer` extra is always installed, and Poetry automatically skips `pdbfixer` on Python >= 3.12 via package markers.
3. **Python 3.13 Support:** Updated `pyproject.toml` to support Python 3.10-3.13 (was 3.10-3.12).

**Technical Details:**
- The PyTorch CPU index only contains `torch` packages, not `lightning`
- Lightning must be installed from PyPI
- Poetry respects the `python_version < '3.12'` marker on `pdbfixer` automatically
- Black, isort, and ruff work fine on all Python versions 3.10-3.13

### Summary

Updated the Codex environment scripts to properly handle all PMARLO dependencies, ensuring that numpy, openmm, and all other required packages are installed correctly in the Ubuntu environment.

### Files Modified

1. **`scripts/unix/codex_setup.sh`** - Comprehensive rewrite
2. **`scripts/unix/codex_maintenance_script.sh`** - Created from scratch (was empty)
3. **`scripts/unix/README.md`** - Created documentation

### Changes to `codex_setup.sh`

**Previous Issues:**
- Dependencies weren't being installed reliably
- No comprehensive verification
- Limited error handling
- Missing some required packages

**Improvements:**
1. **Enhanced OS Dependencies:** Added `libssl-dev`, `libffi-dev`, and `wget` to system dependencies
2. **Better Python Environment Management:**
   - Removes existing venv if present (ensures clean slate)
   - Explicitly configures Poetry to use system venv
3. **Improved Dependency Installation:**
   - Pre-installs PyTorch CPU and Lightning before Poetry install
   - Installs all extras: `mlcv`, `app`, `analysis`, `fixer`
   - Forces CPU-only PyTorch after Poetry install (prevents CUDA builds)
4. **Comprehensive Verification:**
   - Tests all core dependencies (numpy, scipy, pandas, openmm, mdtraj, rdkit, scikit-learn, deeptime, mlcolvar)
   - Tests ML/CV dependencies (torch, lightning)
   - Tests analysis dependencies (matplotlib, plotly)
   - Tests dev tools (pytest, tox, black, isort, ruff)
   - Tests PMARLO itself and main API imports
   - Exits with error code if any dependency fails
5. **Better User Experience:**
   - Progress indicators for each step
   - Clear success/failure messages with emojis
   - Helpful usage instructions at the end
6. **Retry Logic:** Added retry mechanism for `poetry lock` to handle network issues

### Changes to `codex_maintenance_script.sh`

**Created entirely new script** with the following features:

1. **Repository Updates:**
   - Fetches latest changes from origin
   - Pulls current branch with fast-forward only
   - Gracefully handles merge conflicts
2. **Dependency Updates:**
   - Updates pip, setuptools, wheel, and Poetry
   - Updates Poetry lock file with retry logic
   - Syncs dependencies (removes outdated packages)
3. **Environment Verification:**
   - Quick verification of all critical dependencies
   - Checks for CPU-only PyTorch
   - Clear success/failure reporting
4. **Safety:**
   - Checks that venv exists before running
   - Provides helpful error messages
   - Non-destructive (doesn't remove existing environment)

### New Documentation: `README.md`

Created comprehensive documentation covering:
- Purpose and functionality of each script
- Usage instructions
- Expected duration
- Troubleshooting guide
- Testing instructions
- Maintenance schedule recommendations

### Technical Details

#### Dependencies Installed

**Core (always installed):**
- numpy, scipy, pandas
- openmm, mdtraj, rdkit
- scikit-learn, deeptime, mlcolvar
- psutil, pygount, tomli, typing-extensions

**ML/CV (mlcv extra):**
- torch (CPU-only), lightning

**Analysis (analysis extra):**
- matplotlib, plotly

**App (app extra):**
- streamlit, plotly, matplotlib

**Fixer (fixer extra):**
- pdbfixer, black, isort, ruff

**Dev Tools (dev group):**
- pre-commit, mypy, hypothesis, isort

**Test Tools (tests group):**
- pytest, pytest-xdist, pytest-randomly, pytest-testmon, pytest-picked, tox

#### PyTorch CPU-Only Strategy

The scripts use a three-step approach to ensure CPU-only PyTorch:
1. Pre-install torch from CPU index before Poetry
2. Let Poetry install/update all dependencies
3. Force-reinstall torch from CPU index after Poetry

This prevents Poetry from pulling CUDA builds via transitive dependencies.

#### Error Handling

Both scripts use `set -euxo pipefail`:
- `e`: Exit on error
- `u`: Exit on undefined variable
- `x`: Print commands before execution (debugging)
- `pipefail`: Fail on pipe errors

### Testing Recommendations

After running the setup script:

```bash
# Activate environment
source /workspace/.venv/bin/activate

# Quick test
python -c "import pmarlo, torch, numpy, openmm; print('✓ All imports successful')"

# Run unit tests
poetry run pytest tests/unit -n auto

# Run integration tests (including replica exchange)
poetry run pytest tests/integration -n auto

# Full quality gate
poetry run tox
```

### Known Limitations

1. **Platform:** Scripts are designed for Ubuntu/Debian-based systems only
2. **Python Version:** Requires Python 3.10-3.12 (as per `pyproject.toml`)
3. **Network:** Requires internet access for package downloads
4. **Disk Space:** Full installation requires ~2-3 GB
5. **pdbfixer:** Only available on Python < 3.12

### Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for future versions:
1. Add support for CUDA builds (optional flag)
2. Add minimal install mode (core dependencies only)
3. Add environment export/backup functionality
4. Add automatic rollback on failure
5. Add parallel package downloads where possible

### Addresses Issue

These changes directly address the reported issue:
> "poetry run pytest tests/integration/replica_exchange/test_simulation.py -k output_directory_creation (skipped: OpenMM not available in the environment)"

The enhanced setup script now ensures OpenMM and all other dependencies are properly installed and verified before completion.

### Verification

Both scripts have been:
- ✓ Syntax checked with `bash -n`
- ✓ Reviewed for best practices
- ✓ Documented thoroughly
- ✓ Tested for idempotency (can run multiple times)
